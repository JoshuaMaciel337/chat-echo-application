# Chat Echo Application

## Project Overview
The Chat Echo Application is a simple web application built using Flask, a popular Python web framework. It allows users to send messages and receive echo responses. The application serves as a basic example of how to create a RESTful API endpoint that processes JSON data and interacts with a user interface.

## Installation
To get started with the Chat Echo Application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-echo-app.git
   cd chat-echo-app
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   You can install the necessary packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the application**:
   In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to view the index page. You can send messages through the frontend (you should implement the required HTML for this) and receive echoed responses.

## Features
- Simple web interface for sending messages (currently requires HTML implementation).
- RESTful API to handle message requests and provide echoed responses.
- JSON-based communication for easy integration with frontend applications.

## Dependencies
- Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.

  "dependencies": {
